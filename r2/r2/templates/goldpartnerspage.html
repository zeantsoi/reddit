        <h2>OFFICIAL GIVEAWAY RULES</h2>

        <p>reddit and its partners will be giving away prizes to reddit gold members! Please read these rules carefully as they govern our prize giveaways. By entering a giveaway, you agree that these rules will apply to you.</p>

        <h3>How to Enter</h3>
        <p>You don't need to buy anything to enter a giveaway or to win a prize. All eligible reddit gold members may participate in the giveaway. For more information about reddit gold membership, please see&#32;<a href="/gold/about">http://www.reddit.com/gold/about/</a>. The dates of the giveaways will be listed in the prize details below.</p>

        <h3>Other Ways to Enter</h3>
        <p>You can become a reddit gold member for one month by mailing a postcard to reddit c/o Wired, 520 Third Street, San Francisco, CA 94107. For more information, see&#32;<a href="/gold/about#postcard">http://www.reddit.com/gold/about#postcard</a>.</p>

        <h3>Prizes</h3>
        <p>We will describe giveaway dates, prizes and their approximate retail value&#32;<a href="#prize-details" onclick="$('#prize-details').toggle()">here</a>. Your odds of winning depend on the number of reddit gold members - for example, if there are 10,000 reddit gold members, the odds of winning any one prize would be 1 in 10,000. reddit may substitute prizes of equal or greater value if we believe it is necessary.</p>

        <div id="prize-details">

If this happens, we will do our best to pick winners from all eligible, non-fraudulent entries. You hereby release reddit and its partners from all liability of any kind relating to any giveaway or any prize.</p>

        <h3>Privacy and Legal</h3>
