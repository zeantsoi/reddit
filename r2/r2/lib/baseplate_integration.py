"""Transitional integration with Baseplate.

This module provides basic transitional integration with Baseplate. Its intent
is to integrate baseplate-provided functionality (like thrift clients) into
r2's existing diagnostics infrastructure. It is not meant to be the last word
on r2+baseplate; ideally r2 will move towards using more of baseplate rather
than its own implementations.
