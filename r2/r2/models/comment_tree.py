"""Storage for comment trees

CommentTree is a class that provides an interface to the actual storage.
Whatever the underlying storage is, it must be able to generate the following
structures:
* tree: dict of comment id -> list of child comment ids. The `None` entry is
  top level comments
* cids: list of all comment ids in the comment tree
* depth: dict of comment id -> depth
* parents: dict of comment id -> parent comment id

CommentTreeStorageV1 uses permacache as the storage, and stores cids, tree, and
depth as a tuple in one key, and parents in a second key.

Attempts were made to move to a different data model that would take advantage
of the column based storage of Cassandra and eliminate the need for locking when
adding a comment to the comment tree.

CommentTreeStorageV2: for each comment, write a column where the column name is
(parent_comment id, comment_id) and the column value is a counter giving the
size of the subtree rooted at the comment. This data model was abandoned because
counters ended up being unreliable and the shards put too much GC pressure on
the Cassandra JVM.

CommentTreeStorageV3: for each comment, write a column where the column name is
(depth, parent_comment_id, comment_id) and the column value is not used. This
data model was abandoned because of more unexpected GC problems after longer
time periods and generally insufficient regular-case performance.
